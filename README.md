## Syntax Highliting

We use the [Linguist's languages list](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml) as our reference for the proper syntax highlighting based on the given file format. But currently the languges [listed here](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) are supported.

## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
